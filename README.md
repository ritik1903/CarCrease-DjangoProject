# CarCrease-DjangoProject
I am building a real Django project called "Car Crease- A Used Car Selling Business Website" right from scratch.  The basic scenario of this project is, I am creating a website for a car business owner who wants to list his cars on his website and allow the user to come to his site and browse through all of his latest cars and featured cars, search and filter the cars by model or price, and make some inquiries about his cars that are out for the sale.I am using a Bootstrap template and turn it into our Django project's front-end. I also be customizing the default Django admin panel and make it a feature-rich, good-looking admin area. Login with Google & Login with Facebook is the really smart way to attract users into our application.
